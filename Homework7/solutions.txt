2.) floating point addition is unable to be pipelined as it needs to wait for other operations to finish, making it the critical path with 3 cycles, and the lower latency being 3 ( that of floating point addition)

4.) The inner 2 function (with loop unrolling) performed better than the inner1 (without loop unrolling). I ran the test multiple times with 100,000 vector size, they were sometimes comparable, but with the loop unrolled still beating the non loop unrolled, the farthest apart they were was ( 0.001642 - 0.000353), with the closest at ( 0.000460 - 0.000434) *note loop unrolling listed second. As expected loop unrolling can have a notable performance impact.
